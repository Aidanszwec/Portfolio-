  * You'll like this car if you're looking for a sporty, four-passenger convertible that's a thoroughly modern take on a classic model. In the GT trim, the Mustang offers more bang-for-the-buck than pricier models from BMW, Nissan and Audi, all wrapped in a package that smacks of the red, white and blue. Source: KBB.com

Reviews:
  * If you desire a balanced approach to performance, comfort and practicality â?"" and want all three in a reasonably sized sedan â?"" few cars can match the menu provided by BMW's 5 Series. And if, perchance, you're one of the few capable of coordinating your left foot with your right hand, BMW is one of the very few automakers providing the above with a manual transmission â?"" in the 535i and 550i. Source: KBB.com
  * Strong and relatively fuel-efficient turbocharged engines; capable handling; clean interior design with high-quality materials; top safety scores; excellent seats; plenty of high-tech features. Source: Edmunds
